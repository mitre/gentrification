## LTDB (Longitudinal Tract Data Base)

[Diversity and Disparities Project](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/index.htm)

Downloadable Datasets

-   LTDB - DP (LTDB with Differential Privacy)

    -   access confidential microdata in the 2000 census and adds random noise to so that estimates can be disclosed

```{r}
dp <- read_xlsx("raw data/LTDB/LTDB_DP.xlsx")

colnames(dp)
```

-   LTDB - Standard Data Set

    -   Codebook for this dataset

    -   We now offer two standard data sets. The first is for full count variables. It includes the key variables from Census 2010 (race and Hispanic origin, age by race and Hispanic origin, household composition, and housing occupancy and tenure), with comparable variables from the censuses in 1970-2000 and adjusted to 2010 boundaries. The file only includes the population counts for every variable; we leave it to the user to compute percentages or other constructed variables. The second is for sample count variables, characteristics such as median income and occupation. These sample variables for 1970 through 2000 are from the one-in-six decennial censuses, called "long form data." For 2010 we rely on the American Community Survey (ACS 2008-2012), which pools ACS samples across five years, with 2010 as the midpoint.

        The standard data set for each decade is a comma-delimited .txt file with the variable names in the first row. We also provide a codebook that identifies the original tables in each census year from which data have been taken.

```{r}
standard_70 <- read.csv("raw data/LTDB/LTDB_Std_All_fullcount/LTDB_Std_1970_fullcount.csv")
standard_80 <- read.csv("raw data/LTDB/LTDB_Std_All_fullcount/LTDB_Std_1980_fullcount.csv")

head(standard_70)
colnames(standard_70)
```

-   LTDB - Original Data Set

    -   The original data with comparable variables for each year (1970-2010) in the original boundaries and with original tract ID codes are also available for download. Full count and sample count data are provided in separate files. Note that most "full count" variables are also found in the "sample count" file, but their values are different because they are based only on the sample. The Census Bureau did not adjust them to match the full count numbers. The "sample" data for 2010 are from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey.

```{r}
original_70 <- read_xls("data/LTDB/LTDB_Orig_All_fullcount/LTDB_Orig_1970_fullcount.xls")
original_80 <- read_xls("data/LTDB/LTDB_Orig_All_fullcount/LTDB_Orig_1980_fullcount.xls")
```

Crosswalk files: The 2000-2010 crosswalk identifies what kind of boundary change occurred for each tract (the column heading is "changetype"). 1 = no change. 2 = multiple tracts merged to one. 3 = one tract split into more than one. 4 = 2+ tracts reconfigured into different 2+ tracts.

# Methodology

## Gentrification Eligibility

Time Period - 1970s

1.  The tract had a population of at least 500 residents at the beginning and end of a decade and was located within a central city.

    -   How to define location within a central city?

2.  The tract's median household income was in the bottom 40th percentile when compared to all tracts within its metro area at the beginning of the decade.

    -   Metro Area - defined as Metropolitan or Micropolitan Statistical Area by OMB

    -   CBSA - Core Based Statistical Area

    -   [Guidance for Data Users (census.gov)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/guidance.html)

3.  The tract's median home value was in the bottom 40th percentile when compared to all tracts within its metro area at the beginning of the decade.

Data Needed to Collect from LTDB

-   2010 Tract ID

-   Population size 1970 - `pop70`

-   Population size 1980 - `pop80`

-   Median household income in 1970 - `tract_70$hinc70`

-   Median home value in 1970 - `tract_70$mhmval70`

-   Metro Area - `standard_70$cbsa10`

```{r}
standard_70 %>%
  filter(state == "OR",
         county == "Multnomah County")
```

```{r}
or <- tract_70 %>%
  filter(STATE == "Oregon",
        COUNTY == "Multnomah")
  

or %>%
  mutate(state_num = as.character(STATEA),
         state_num = substr(state_num, 1, nchar(state_num)-1),
         county_num = as.character(COUNTYA),
         county_num = substr(county_num, 1, nchar(county_num)-1),
         tract_num = as.character(TRACTA),
         tract_num = str_pad(tract_num, width = 6, side = "right", pad = 0),
         tract_id = as.numeric(paste0(state_num, county_num, tract_num))) %>%
  full_join(standard_70, by = c("tract_id" = "TRTID10")) %>%
  select(tract_id, everything())
```

### Tract Eligibility

```{r}

# Find bottom 40th percentile values for household income and median home value by county (WILL NEED TO EDIT BY METRO AREA)
bottom_40th <- tract_70 %>%
  select(STATE, COUNTY, HINC70, MHMVAL70) %>%
  group_by(STATE, COUNTY) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(quantile(., 0.4, na.rm = T)), HINC70, MHMVAL70)


# Append 40th percentile value to Tract 70 data  
eligibile <- tract_70 %>%
  left_join(bottom_40th, by = c("STATE", "COUNTY"), suffix = c("", "_40th")) %>%
  mutate(pop_greater_500_70 = ifelse(POP70 > 500, T, F),
         hinc_less_40th = ifelse(HINC70 < HINC70_40th, T, F),
         mhm_less_40th = ifelse(MHMVAL70 < MHMVAL70_40th, T, F)) %>%
  mutate(eligible = ifelse(pop_greater_500_70 & hinc_less_40th & mhm_less_40th, T, F))

## Identifies eligible tracts
eligibile %>% select(86:89) %>%
group_by(pop_greater_500_70, hinc_less_40th, mhm_less_40th, eligible) %>%
  count()
  
  

```

## Gentrification Determination

Time Period - 2019?

1.  An increase in a tract's educational attainment, as measured by the percentage of residents age 25 and over holding bachelor's degrees, was in the top third percentile of all tracts within a metro area.

2.  A tract's median home value increased when adjusted for inflation.

-   <https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1970?endYear=2019&amount=1>
-   From 1970 - 2019
-   \$1 = \$6.59
-   Average 3.92% inflation
-   Cumulative price increase 558.91%

3.  The percentage increase in a tract's inflation-adjusted median home value was in the top third percentile of all tracts within a metro area.

### Statistical Areas

[OMB 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (govinfo.gov)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2010-06-28/pdf/2010-15605.pdf)

![](CensusGeo.PNG)

**Core Based Statistical Area**: geographic entity associated with at least one core of 10,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.

-   Does not consist of urban / Rural classification

<!-- -->

-   **Metropolitan Statistical Area**: an area containing a large population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus

-   **Micropolitan Statistical Area**: closely parallels that of the metropolitan statistical area, but a micropolitan statistical area features a smaller nucleus

```{r}
gaz_cbsa <- read_tsv("data/Crosswalks/2019_Gaz_cbsa_national.txt")
gaz_tracts <- read_tsv("data/Crosswalks/2019_Gaz_tracts_national.txt")
```

Data needed to collect from ACS

-   2010 Tract ID

-   \% 25+ with bachelor's degree

-   Median home value (inflation adjusted)

-   \% increase in tract's inflation adjusted median home value

```{r}
acs <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
               output = "wide",
               year = 2019,
               state = "MD",
               variables = c(`Total Population` = "B01001_001", #Total Pop 
                             `Bachelors Degree` = "B06009_006", #Bachelor's Degree
                             `Median Income` = "B06011_001",  #Median Income
                             `Median Home Value` = "B25109_001" #Median Home Value
               ))
```

Process the data:

-   Create new columns for % Bachelors

-   Adjust median home value for inflation

-   Indicator of top 3rd Bachelors

-   Indicator for Tract Price Increase

-   Indicator for top 3rd Home Value

## Asthma Outcomes

```{r}
places <- read.csv("data/PLACES__Census_Tract_Data__GIS_Friendly_Format___2020_release.csv")

md_outcomes <- left_join(md_gentrified, places, by = c("GEOID" = "TractFIPS"))
```

### Model 1: Simple Regression

$$
Asthma_i = 9.9782 + 0.4342(HOLC_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(CASTHMA_CrudePrev ~ holc_grade_pop, data = md_outcomes)
summary(mod1)

```

```{r}
ggplot(md_outcomes, 
       aes(x = holc_grade_pop, y = CASTHMA_CrudePrev)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Model 2: Gentrification in model

$$
Asthma_i = 9.9782 + 0.4342(HOLC_i) - 1.6463(Gentrified) + \epsilon_i
$$

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(CASTHMA_CrudePrev ~ holc_grade_pop + gentrified, data = md_outcomes)
summary(mod2)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(mod2$fitted.values, mod2$residuals)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "Red") +
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Model 3: Gentrification as Interaction (Effect Modifier)

$$
Asthma_i = 9.4860 + 0.6858(HOLC_i) + 0.2011(Gentrified) - 0.5346(HOLC*Gentrified) + \epsilon_i
$$

For Gentrified areas:

-   \$ Asthma = 9.6871 + 0.1512(HOLC) + \epsilon \$

For non Gentrified areas:

-   \$ Asthma = 9.4860 +0.6858(HOLC) + \epsilon \$

```{r}
mod3 <- lm(CASTHMA_CrudePrev ~ holc_grade_pop * gentrified, data = md_outcomes)
summary(mod3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(md_outcomes, 
       aes(x = holc_grade_pop, y = CASTHMA_CrudePrev, group = gentrified)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = gentrified)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  theme_minimal()
```

mod1 <- lm(DIABETES_CrudePrev ~ holc_grade_pop, data = md_outcomes)
summary(mod1)

```

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(DIABETES_CrudePrev ~ holc_grade_pop + gentrified, data = md_outcomes)
